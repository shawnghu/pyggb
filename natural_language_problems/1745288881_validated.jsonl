In particular a 180\u00b0\u2010rotation is an isometry, so it carries every circle to a congruent circle of the same radius.\n\nLet us review the three steps:\n\n1.  We start with \u03c9, whose center is K and whose radius is \n\\[R = NE\\,.\\]  \n2.  We reflect \u03c9 through A to get the circle X.  Since a point\u2013reflection fixes distances, X also has radius R.  Its center P is just the image of K under the 180\u00b0 rotation about A, namely the point P with A the midpoint of KP.  \n3.  If we now reflect (the original) \u03c9 through P\u2014or equivalently reflect X through P\u2014the resulting circle \u0393 again has exactly the same radius R.\n\nThus the final radius r of \u0393 is r=R=NE.  But in the angle\u2010bisector setup one checks easily that N is the reflection of E across the bisector of \u2220EBA, hence BN=BE=2.1, and so R=NE depends only on BE; in fact NE=BE.
